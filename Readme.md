- ```Codebook.md``` that describes the process of getting the data and variables used to prepare and work with the data  
- ```run_analysis.R``` that contains the code used to preform data downloading, preparation and performing tasks as required under the assignment.  
- ```Newtidydata.txt``` text file that resulted after all the tasks.
